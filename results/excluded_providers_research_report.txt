METHODOLOGY NOTE
================================================================================

This report was compiled through systematic web searches using multiple search
strategies for each provider, including:
- Name + location + "medicaid fraud"
- Name + specialty + "excluded"
- Name + location + "indictment OR convicted OR sentenced"
- Business name + "medicaid fraud"
- NPI number + "excluded"
- DOJ press releases
- OIG enforcement action pages
- State medical board records
- News archives
- Professional directories and NPI registries

For providers where limited information was found (We Care Transportation, Twin
Cities Care Services, Ebony Gibson, Diana Gallardo), the authoritative source
for exclusion records would be the OIG LEIE database at exclusions.oig.hhs.gov,
which was not directly queryable through web search.
